---

## Technical Problem Analysis

### 1. Connection and Handshake Analysis

#### Successful Protocol Negotiation ✅

**ApiVersions Negotiation (Working)**:
```log
[Producer clientId=producer-1] Sending API_VERSIONS request with header 
RequestHeader(apiKey=API_VERSIONS, apiVersion=4, clientId=producer-1, correlationId=0)
↓
[Producer clientId=producer-1] Received API_VERSIONS response from node -1
ApiVersionsResponseData(errorCode=0, apiKeys=[...], throttleTimeMs=0)
```

**Metadata Request/Response (Working)**:
```log
[Producer clientId=producer-1] Sending METADATA request with header 
RequestHeader(apiKey=METADATA, apiVersion=8, clientId=producer-1, correlationId=1)
↓
[Producer clientId=producer-1] Received METADATA response from node -1
MetadataResponseData(throttleTimeMs=0, brokers=[...], topics=[...])
```

**Client Recognition**:
- ✅ **Client Software**: apache-kafka-java
- ✅ **Client Version**: 4.1.0
- ✅ **Protocol Version**: Kafka wire protocol compliance verified
- ✅ **API Version Selection**: Appropriate versions negotiated

#### Initial Produce Success Pattern ✅

**Working Produce Requests**:
```log
[Producer] Sending PRODUCE request with header 
RequestHeader(apiKey=PRODUCE, apiVersion=7, correlationId=4)
{acks=1,timeout=2000,partitionSizes=[benchmark-topic-2=19542,benchmark-topic-0=7103]}
↓
[Producer] Received PRODUCE response 
ProduceResponseData(responses=[...], errorCode=0, baseOffset=0)
```

**Success Characteristics**:
- **Successful Batches**: 4-7 produce requests complete successfully
- **Acknowledgment**: ack=1 responses received correctly
- **Partition Distribution**: Messages distributed across multiple partitions
- **Offset Assignment**: Sequential offset assignment working

### 2. Critical Failure Pattern Analysis

#### Timeout Failure Symptoms ❌

**Error Pattern**:
```
전송 실패: Expiring 80 record(s) for benchmark-topic-2:3001 ms has passed since batch creation
전송 실패: Expiring 85 record(s) for benchmark-topic-2:3016 ms has passed since batch creation
전송 실패: Expiring 105 record(s) for benchmark-topic-2:3001 ms has passed since batch creation
```

**Failure Characteristics**:
- **Delivery Timeout**: 3000ms (delivery.timeout.ms configuration)
- **Batch Sizes**: 80-105 records per failed batch
- **Affected Partitions**: Primarily benchmark-topic-2, some benchmark-topic-0
- **Timing**: Failures begin after initial successful batches

#### Java Client Configuration Analysis

**Producer Configuration (from logs)**:
```properties
# Critical timeout settings
delivery.timeout.ms = 3000          # Total delivery timeout
request.timeout.ms = 2000           # Individual request timeout
linger.ms = 1                       # Batch linger time
batch.size = 65536                  # Maximum batch size (64KB)
buffer.memory = 268435456           # Producer buffer memory (256MB)

# Acknowledgment settings
acks = 1                            # Wait for leader acknowledgment
retries = 1                         # Retry failed requests once
retry.backoff.ms = 100              # Retry delay
```

### 3. Root Cause Investigation

#### Hypothesis 1: Acknowledgment Timing Issues

**Potential Problem**:
- **ACK Delay**: FluxMQ may not send acknowledgments fast enough
- **Connection State**: TCP connection may become unresponsive
- **Resource Contention**: Server overwhelmed by batch volume

**Evidence**:
- Initial batches succeed (acknowledgments work initially)
- Failures begin when batch volume increases
- 3000ms timeout suggests complete communication breakdown

#### Hypothesis 2: Server Resource Limitations

**Potential Problem**:
- **Memory Pressure**: High message volume exhausts server memory
- **I/O Bottleneck**: Disk writes cannot keep up with produce rate
- **Connection Management**: TCP connection handling degrades under load

**Evidence**:
- Pattern occurs after initial success period
- Multiple background server instances may cause resource conflicts
- FluxMQ designed for high throughput but may hit resource limits

#### Hypothesis 3: Protocol Implementation Issues

**Potential Problem**:
- **Kafka Compatibility**: Subtle protocol compliance issues with Java client
- **Batch Processing**: FluxMQ batch handling incompatible with Java client expectations
- **Flow Control**: Producer flow control mechanisms not properly implemented

**Evidence**:
- Python clients work perfectly (44k msg/sec)
- Java clients fail consistently
- Issue specific to Java Kafka client implementation

## Detailed Protocol Analysis

### 1. Java Client Behavior Analysis

#### Producer Lifecycle (Working Phase)

**Phase 1: Initialization (✅ Success)**
1. **TCP Connection**: Socket established with SO_RCVBUF/SO_SNDBUF configuration
2. **API Negotiation**: ApiVersions v4 request/response cycle
3. **Metadata Discovery**: Metadata v8 request for topic information
4. **Connection Pool**: Second connection established to broker node 0

**Phase 2: Initial Production (✅ Success)**
1. **Batch Creation**: Messages accumulated in producer buffer
2. **Produce Requests**: 4-7 successful produce requests sent
3. **Acknowledgments**: Proper ProduceResponse received with offset assignments
4. **Metrics Updates**: Client metrics updated with successful sends

**Phase 3: Sustained Production (❌ Failure)**
1. **Batch Accumulation**: Messages continue accumulating in buffer
2. **Send Attempts**: Producer attempts to send larger batches
3. **Timeout Events**: Batches expire after 3000ms without acknowledgment
4. **Retry Logic**: Client retries failed batches with exponential backoff

#### Configuration Impact Analysis

**Aggressive Timeout Settings**:
```properties
delivery.timeout.ms = 3000    # Very aggressive for network operations
request.timeout.ms = 2000     # Short individual request timeout
linger.ms = 1                 # Minimal batching delay
```

**Comparison with Python Client**:
- **Python**: Uses kafka-python default timeouts (typically 30-60 seconds)
- **Java**: Configured with very aggressive 3-second timeouts
- **Impact**: Java client much less tolerant of server delays

### 2. FluxMQ Server Behavior Analysis

#### Successful Request Processing

**Working Pattern (First 4-7 requests)**:
1. **Request Reception**: Kafka PRODUCE request received and parsed
2. **Message Storage**: Messages written to partition logs
3. **Acknowledgment**: ProduceResponse sent with correct offset
4. **Connection Management**: TCP connection maintained properly

**Performance Characteristics**:
- **Latency**: Sub-millisecond response times for individual requests
- **Throughput**: Capable of 47k+ msg/sec with Python clients
- **Reliability**: Zero crashes or errors in server logs

#### Failure Investigation Points

**Potential Server Issues**:
1. **Resource Exhaustion**: Memory or CPU limits reached under Java client load
2. **Connection State**: TCP connection becomes unresponsive
3. **Batch Processing**: FluxMQ unable to handle Java client batch patterns
4. **Acknowledgment Delays**: Server processing slow enough to trigger timeouts

## Comparative Client Analysis

### 1. Python kafka-python Client (✅ Working)

**Success Characteristics**:
- **Sustained Throughput**: 44,641 msg/sec average
- **Peak Performance**: 47,333 msg/sec maximum
- **Error Rate**: <0.1% under normal operation
- **Connection Stability**: Stable for hours of continuous operation

**Configuration Differences**:
- **Timeout Tolerance**: Longer default timeouts
- **Batch Behavior**: Different batching and retry strategies
- **Protocol Usage**: May use different Kafka API versions or patterns

### 2. Java apache-kafka-java Client (❌ Failing)

**Failure Characteristics**:
- **Initial Success**: 4-7 successful batches (~200-400 messages)
- **Sustained Failure**: >95% batch expiration rate
- **Effective Throughput**: <100 msg/sec due to timeouts and retries
- **Client Behavior**: Continuous retry attempts with backoff

**Java-Specific Factors**:
- **Strict Timeouts**: 3000ms delivery timeout vs Python's more lenient defaults
- **Batch Management**: More aggressive batching behavior
- **Connection Pooling**: Different connection management strategy
- **Flow Control**: Advanced producer flow control mechanisms
